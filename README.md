# ssh-connection-helper
Manage your ssh connections with a simple script

Create a folder called 'bookmark' under the same path from the script.
You can create a bookmark file, which is the parent and input all the ssh servers you have inside.
That way you can organize them well.
Since nobody wants to type in the name of the bookmark file completly, you can easily choose it via a number

Addding a new server to a bookmark file can obviously be done by: echo "ssh.server.eu" >> ~/Scriptpath/bookmarks/file1

Hope you enjoy.
